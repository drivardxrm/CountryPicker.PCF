* üìö[Try Component in Storybook](https://drivardxrm.github.io/CountryPicker.PCF/)


* Download latest version here : https://github.com/drivardxrm/CountryPicker.PCF/releases/latest

#### IMPORTANT : AS OF v3.0.0.3 - Dependency on restcountries API was removed
üîÑ Removed dependency on the RestCountries API
The external API introduced a breaking change, so the control no longer relies on it.

üìÅ Switched to a local static JSON file for country data
Country names and codes are now loaded from a bundled file. This improves reliability and ensures the control works consistently.

‚ùå Removed country info feature
Since the local file only contains basic country data, the additional country information feature (e.g., population, region) has been removed. It was useful for demos but didn't add much practical value in real use cases.


#### Features:

* Promote some countries to appear first in the combobox.

* Limit the available countries to show only the one that matters to your use case

* Country names available in several languages. (English, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Persian)

* Country information comes from this public API project : https://restcountries.com/  
##### DISCLAIMER : The author of the project is not responsible for the accuracy of the content of the API
